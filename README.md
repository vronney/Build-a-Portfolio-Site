# Build-a-Portfolio-Site

The purpose for Build-a-Portfolio-Site was to demonstrate my abilities to use:
- HTML and CSS
- develop a responsive website with images, descriptions and links

The images are free images from the internet.

Breakpoints were place at 419px - this was done to have a better look and layout on a smaller device and then going to a laptop.

Three images were added with links to other websites.  Hover was added in CSS for each image - whenever the mouse was hovered over the image the image would enlarge to a scale of 1.5%.

At the breakpoint before 419px the layout is with all images in a column.

At the breakpoint at 420px the layout changes to the three images in a row.
